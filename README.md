# fishing-pier

- infinitely loops a transition between four files: from day to dusk to night to twilight back to day
- has fish that swim around
- you can click, drag, and drop the fish
- you can drag fish to the bucket to collect them

TODO:
- clean up & refactor (wip)
- allow drop-into-bucket: currently fish are only destroyed when they're dragged over the bucket and released; if you drop them in they go through the bucket and back into the water
